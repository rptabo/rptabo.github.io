### Freeform Rant
Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
...Well no, actually: violets are violet; that's why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're called "violet"s. And if Roy G. Biv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taught us anything about the color<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectrum, it's that there is a whole nother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color (indigo) in between blue and violet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so whoever said violets are blue might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borderline colorblind.<br>
But hey, I still love you.

### Poem-Within-a-Poem
Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
...Well no, actually: violets are violet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why they're called "violet"s. And while it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has a nice ring in the poem, we know, "Indigo:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between blue and violet, in you go"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a famous edict of Roy G. Biv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when creating the color spectrum to give.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So whoever said violets are blue to match roses red<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is probably borderline colorblind (aka "eye dead").<br>
But hey, I still love _you_.
