Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
...Well no, actually: violets are violet; that's why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're called "violet"s. And if Roy G. Biv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taught us anything about the color<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectrum, it's that there is a whole nother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color (indigo) in between blue and violet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so whoever said violets are blue might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borderline colorblind.<br>
But hey, I still love you.
