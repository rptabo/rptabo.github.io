### Free-Form Rant
Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 2.5em; text-indent: -2.5em;">
...Well no, actually: violets are violet; that's why they're called "violet"s. And if Roy G. Biv taught us anything about the color spectrum, it's that there is a whole 'nother color (indigo) in between blue and violet so whoever said violets are blue might be borderline colorblind.

But hey, I still love you.

### Poem-Within-a-Poem
Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 2.5em; text-indent: -2.5em;">
...Well no, actually: violets are violet;<br>
    that's why they're called "violet"s. And while it<br>
    has a nice ring in the poem, we know, "Indigo:<br>
    between blue and violet, in you go"<br>
    is a famous edict of Roy G. Biv<br>
    when creating the color spectrum by which we live.<br>
    So whoever said violets are blue to match roses red<br>
    is probably borderline colorblind (aka "eye dead").<br>

But hey, I still love _you_.
