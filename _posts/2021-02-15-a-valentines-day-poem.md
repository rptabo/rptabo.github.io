Roses are red, violets are blue,<br>
...well no, actually: violets are violet; that's why they're called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "violet"s. And if Roy G. Biv taught us anything about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color spectrum, it's that there is a whole nother color<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (indigo) in between blue and violet so whoever said violets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are blue might be borderline colorblind.<br>
But hey, I still love you.
