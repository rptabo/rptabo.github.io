I came across [this idea][post] and although I've still only skimmed the post, I recalled it when experiencing a beautiful moment before Mass on Labor Day and composed this haiku:

>Smoke wisp<br>
>Honored candles<br>
>Christ above<br>

Update: My brother was being a stickler about syllables so here is a "correct" version:

>Smoke wisp curling up<br>
>Honored candles stand apart<br>
>Christ above sees all<br>
