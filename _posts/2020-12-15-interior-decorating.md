These are the elements that make for good interior decorating in my opinion:

- Dark brown wood
- Dark brown leather
- Books
- Plants
- Flowers
- Candles
- Lighting
- Icons and other art
- Not much else

Simplified: wood, leather, paper, life, light, art, and not much else

Even simpler: plants alive and dead, cows dead, light, and pictures
