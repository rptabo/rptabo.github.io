I view Liberalism as a virus. Much like a biological one, the virus of Liberalism infects an area until it is uninhabitable and then moves on, continuing the process until there is nothing left to destroy. Which is kind of ironic since one of many Liberals' big initiatives is to push that climate change needs to be stopped for doing the same thing to our planet.

I saw it happen growing up in Colorado. So many Californians moved there because California had gotten so unaffordable and otherwise unenjoyable. So they moved to Colorado where for the price of their small condo they could afford a mansion. Things were okay at first but this was the basic progression:

- "Colorado is awesome! I love it here."
- "But seriously, we need some more welfare and other government-run programs."
- "Higher taxes will help fund a lot of the initiatives we really need here in Colorado."
- [More stupid ideas]
- "Colorado is so expensive, overcrowded, and restrictive. I'm thinking about moving."

Texas is seeing the same thing with New Yorkers. And now former Californians-turned-Coloradans.
