## Morning offering
Dear Lord, I offer you all my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day. May I work prayerfully and suffer joyfully.

I pray that I come to the further realization that I can do absolutely nothing without you and therefore I beg that you constantly remind me to ask you for help in everything I do. Amen.

## Prayers after Mass
Our Father.<br>
Hail Mary.<br>

Dear Lord, thank you for giving me this opportunity to receive Your Body and Blood into my body and blood. May They flow through every artery, vein, and capillary; fuse with every molecule and atom; thereby transforming me so that I may better do Thy Will, by Thy Grace, for Thy Greater Glory. And by my faith and my works may I become your Saint. Amen.<br>

Glory Be.<br>
