The key to achieving anything with the best possible outcome is to have the best person complete each key element. Sometimes that's you...but most of the time it isn't. You need to get buy-in. Sell people on your vision to the point that they want to do it so you don't need to tell them to. Speak to their core drivers. Decide whose talents best fit the needs. Then only do what only you can.

There are different tactics for gaining buy-in: vision enthrallment, making them think it's their own idea, convincing them of the great need. What wins them over all depends on their personality. But never be dishonest: always act with integrity. If what you are trying to do is not worthwhile, tricks only go so far anyway end up causing more headache.
