Looking at the current climate in America, I see three main historical parallels:

1. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
1. The French Revolution
1. The Rwandan Genocide

America has lasted longer than most empires. I believe there are a few reasons for this:

- The founding principles of America were the greatest in history
- The human lifespan is longer than ever
- The "Greatest Generation" and World War II served as a "reset"

It's not so much the number of years, but the number of generations before ideals are so watered down or forgotten and comfort is too embedded.

Substitute Twitter for the radio, Conservatives (and/or whites) for Tutsis, and the Rwandan parallels with much of what we have seen in the Black Lives Matter movement are pretty apparent.
