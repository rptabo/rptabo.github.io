I'm not normally into conspiracy theories, but sometimes things seem just too obvious. Supposedly the whole Black Lives Matter movement exploded with the death of George Floyd. But it's conspicuous that suddenly all the TV shows coming out recently also focus on it. Bear in mind, it takes time to write, produce, edit, add CGI, market, and release these shows. And also bear in mind that the lockdown shut down production so many of the shows coming out now have been in the can since the beginning of the year at the latest. With all of that information I find it hard to believe that this wasn't planned for right before an election.

Take The Umbrella Academy for example. Season 2 came out just a month or so ago and has a lot of special effects. Yet one of the key storylines revolves around a black woman who, along with her adopted siblings, traveled back in time and she is now a key member of the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. She organizes sit-ins and deals with terrible epithets and violence because of her race. Very coincindental...

But that's not the only example. Season 2 of Hanna has a black female lead character and so does the new Netflix original starring Charlize Theron. It's almost as if everyone knew Kamala Harris was going to be chosen as the VP candidate so production started a while ago to emphasize strong black female leads. Everyone expects her to become president pretty soon into the term anyway.

Now this part of the theory isn't too far-fetched. I have a friend who worked for a network television showrunner and various showrunners would get together on a regular basis to literally discuss what agenda they were going to push in a coordinated fashion. Michelle Obama joined one time to thank them for their efforts in the "marriage equality fight" for which they were celebrating victory.

So the conspiracy isn't so much around whether Hollywood is organized around the issue. It's around who's pulling the strings to incite the narrative on a wider scale that has led to so much violence.

What I'm most apprehensive about is the release of a film called "Judas and the Black Messiah." It focuses on the Black Panthers and I worry it will promote even more violence.
