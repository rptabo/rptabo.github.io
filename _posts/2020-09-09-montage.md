The part of the movie that is most quickly glossed over---that is, the montage---is often the most important part. It is the daily grind, the slow progress, the setbacks, the mere patience through the passage of time that allows the hero to take those months and often years of hard effort to succeed in one triumphant moment.

As James Clear [points out][jc], people often want the results but not the lifestyle that makes them possible:

>In the long-run, the people who succeed are the ones who want to live the lifestyle that precedes the results.
>
>Stop asking, "What results do I want to have?"
>
>Start asking, "What lifestyle do I want to live?"
>
>It's common to want results. It's rare to want the lifestyle.
