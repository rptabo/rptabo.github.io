I met a cute woman with a dog outside my building shortly after moving in. The dog's name was Van Gogh and I was informed that he was going blind. Later that evening I came up with a clever remark.

A couple months later I ran into the same woman and dog and got the same introduction. This time I was ready: "Well, at least both his ears are still intact."

Blank stare.
