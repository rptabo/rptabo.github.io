## The words and ways of women are indecipherable to us mere mortal men.

# In Poem Format
The words and ways of women<br>
Manifest as mysteries to me,<br>
Mere mortal man that I am.<br>
For far further than the female figure<br>
They think their thorough thoughts through<br>
While worldwide we wonder where they wander,<br>
Failing to fully fathom their fine feminine features.
