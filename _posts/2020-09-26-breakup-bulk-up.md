I've noticed an interesting phenomenon where some men get ripped after a major breakup. I call it the "breakup bulk-up" and think it has to do with these men suddenly having more time and emotion on their hands and working out is an excellent outlet. The emotion consists not only of anger and hurt but also a misplaced desire for revenge of sorts: by getting into shape, they can attract an even more attractive partner to show their ex they are better off.

Of course, I've also seen the opposite in emotional eaters.
