I recently met someone who argued that no single person should have a pet. Since this wasn't a matter of faith and morals, I let him continue without revealing that I (a single person) have a dog. I even laid out my exact scenario to hear his thoughts without bias, because he might not have given his honest opinion if he thought he was offending me. Ultimately none of his views fazed me, mostly because I try not to take relationship advice from a single person.

But I also regret not being able to put forth my viewpoint so I'll use this opportunity to show the benefits of having a pet (in my case, a dog)---especially when single.

Pets:
- Teach responsibility
- Give an opportunity for self-sacrifice
- If you can't be in a relationship, you can't have kids but pets teach similar lessons. It's not the same as children, but it's better than the alternative (nothing)
- Illuminate to a certain degree our relationship with God
