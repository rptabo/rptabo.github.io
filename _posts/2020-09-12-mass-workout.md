# Introduction
Christians are called to care for their bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit, so why not use the Mass as the model for the perfect home workout? By thinking through how to set up the program, we can unify our entire being---Mind, Body, and Spirit---just as we do in the Mass.

# An initial walk through the Mass
Our experience of the Mass incorporates our whole bodies. Below are some of the movements we make at the different parts.

When you first come into the church, you typically dip your hand into the holy water font and make the sign of the cross. Do the same before you begin your workout to bless it. I start every workout I do with the sign of the cross and uttering _Ad maiorem Dei gloriam_.

Then you go to your pew and genuflect. Kneel and pray before Mass. Sit back in the pew and look up at the Crucifix until it's time for Mass to begin.

Invited to greet others so do some twists. Then squats to rise for the procession.

Pushups for priest's prostration.

Stairs for lector going up.

# Revisiting for a "walk" through the Mass
We are all called to a royal priesthood so I am also incorporating what the priest does in the liturgy during our workout.

# Key
- Genuflect: lunges
- Stand/sit: squats
- Kneel: pushups or dips
- Bow: good mornings
- Sign of the cross: shoulder press/pullup (work with me here)
- 10r = 10 reps; 10s = 10 seconds (for holds)

# Program
This is an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) program, so complete the following circuit as many times as you are able (in good form!) for 20 minutes:

- 10r lunges
- 10r squats
- 5r pushups
- 5r dips
- 10r good mornings
- 10r shoulder press
- 2r pullup
- 5 stairs
