# Introduction
Christians are called to care for their bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit, so why not use the Mass as the model for the perfect home workout? By thinking through how to set up the program, we can unify our entire being---Spirit, Mind, and Body---just as we do in the Mass.

# An initial walk through the Mass
Our experience of the Mass incorporates our whole bodies. Below are some of the movements we make during the different parts of the liturgy.

When you first come into the church, you typically dip your hand into the holy water font and make the sign of the cross. Do the same before you begin your workout to bless it. I start every workout by making the sign of the cross and uttering "_Ad maiorem Dei gloriam_".

Then you go to your pew and genuflect. Kneel and pray before Mass. Sit back in the pew and look up at the Crucifix until it's time for Mass to begin.

- Invited to greet others so do some twists. Then squats to rise for the procession.
- Pushups for priest's prostration
- Beat chest for mea culpa
- Nod head for Gloria
- Bow for Let Us Pray
- Squats for sitting back down
- Stairs for lector going up
- Squats for rising for the Gospel
- Sign of the cross on forehead, lips, heart
- Sit down again
- Stand up for prayers of the faithful
- Twists for passing the offertory basket
- Stand up
- Kneel
- Bow while kneeling
- Stand up
- Sign of peace
- Kneel
- Stand up
- Walk to receive Communion

# Revisiting for a "walk" through the Mass
We are all called to a royal priesthood so I am also incorporating what the priest does in the liturgy during our workout.

"A Bodily Walk Through the Mass" (as opposed to a Biblical Walk)

# Key
- Genuflect: lunges
- Stand/sit: squats
- Kneel: pushups or dips
- Bow: good mornings
- Sign of the cross: shoulder press/pullup (work with me here)
- Burpees?
- Twists: Seated Russian Twists
- 10r = 10 reps; 10s = 10 seconds (for holds)

# Program
This is an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) program, so complete the following circuit as many times as you are able (in good form!) for 20 minutes:

- 10r lunges
- 10r squats
- 5r pushups
- 5r dips
- 10r good mornings
- 10r shoulder press
- 2r pullup
- 5 stairs
