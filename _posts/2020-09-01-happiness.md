[NOTE: This is still very much in draft mode. But because I strive to live by "memento mori" and recognize that at any moment I could die, I am pushing these thoughts before they are completely fleshed out.]

I've read a lot on the same topic recently:

- The Mindful Catholic
- Finding True Happiness
- The Screwtape Letters
- Trustful Surrender to Divine Providence
- Searching for and Maintaining Peace
- Abandonment to Divine Providence
- The Consolation of Philosophy

- Made for More
- Songs of Innocence and of Experience

Summary: Be present in the current now. Delight in everything it brings. God is infinitely wiser than you and it's all for your good.

The key to happiness: Use the current moment to serve. You are happiest when not focused on yourself.

Don't be a hedonist; do your duty in the moment (which is sometimes to plan).

The key is to live _in_ the moment, not live _for_ the moment, for we are living for Heaven, the eternal "now."

I had been contemplating Eternity for a while and came up with an analogy. Reading Boethius crushed my dreams for I came to discover he had explained it very simarly more than a millenia before, but perhaps my analogy is more easily grasped by modern times than the chariot example he gives so I'm going to lay it out anyway.

We live in time, where events unfold sequentially. God lives outside of time--time is his invention--where everything just _is_. Eternity therefore is a state of being, completely unrelated to time.

Imagine a digital photograph loading over a really old dial-up internet connection, but even slower. Rather than even line by line, in time, we experience this picture loading pixel by pixel. Sometimes it doesn't make sense. We have several blue pixels in a row and then all of a sudden there is a red pixel. It makes no sense in the moment, but once the picture has fully loaded, we see the beauty in it.

God seeing the picture as it is does not affect our free will, for just as we view a picture we did not take in its totality, so each pixel within it was not ordained by God.

However, God does act within time. His Will is ordained daily and there have been times in history (he even entered it in the Person of Jesus) where he plays a significant role. So to better adapt the analogy, he is very actively involved in the creation of the painting.

But people sin: imagine these as an artist's accident where paint spills. But God can use this accident to make something even more beautiful than had that not happened. He can work around it, go over the top, even use a sharp knife to scrape the paint from the canvas so that in the final viewing it is as if it never happened.

Some seek death and deny eternity because they just want it all to stop. No more demands, no more suffering, just ceasing to exist. Really, they want peace and the stop of entropy (which is essentially the same).

Every analogy is imperfect, especially when dealing with a Mystery so outside our comprehension as time and Eternity. We just do not have the capacity to fully comprehend. It is like my dog, who is very smart. Yet even the smartest dog in the world does not have the capacity to perform differential calculus.
