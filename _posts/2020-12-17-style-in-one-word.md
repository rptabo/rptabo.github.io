Style can be summarized in one word (that is only three letters, to boot): fit. Now, there are two different contexts to this word, however; more precisely, the clothes should fit a body that's fit.

If the clothes don't fit even the fittest person alive, the impression is not going to look as good as it could. Likewise, given two people wearing the exact same outfit with appropriate tailoring, the fitter one will always look better.
