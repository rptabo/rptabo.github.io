There is a lot of talk about "white privilege" these days. But I often wonder: is the current state of the average heterosexual white male---the epitome of "privilege"---really what everyone is looking for? Does everyone want to be strapped with debt, trying to keep up with the Joneses?

In reality, happiness is everyone's ultimate aim. Yet viewing things purely from that perspective, the poor are often the happiest people. I often hear of missionaries who visit Africa or third world countries elsewhere and describe how the people they met are the most joyful, happy peole they have ever met, despite their abject poverty. I believe this is because they live in the moment and are not worried about impressing others or dealing with the complications of modern first world life and all of the superficial concerns that entails.
