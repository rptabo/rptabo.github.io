It is no coincidence that elements of relationships reference fire, for that is truly one of the most analogous guides.

In the early stages, many people ask if there is a "spark" and that is really what is required to start. Many relationships never make it past the first date because this is lacking from one or both parties' perspectives.

But if there is a spark, the next stages are absolutely critical. There must be fuel to continue; however big logs are of no avail: rather, little kindling will allow the nascent fire to grow without being smothered. The spark needs oxygen to develop into a small flame, but also must be protected from the elements so as to avoid being extinguished entirely. You can blow on a fire to help it grow, but it must be far enough along so that you don't completely blow it out. For a second, the flames seem to disappear as a result, but then they jump back larger than ever.

As the flame grows, it requires larger and larger fuel and a fire will only grow as large as its supply. But the fire must always be fed and as time progresses, this requires logs that must constantly be tended to and added. If the fire is ever neglected for too long, it will ultimately extinguish; and the longer it is neglected, the more effort it will take to build it back up and the couple must revisit the early stages again before they can progress back to logs. But luckily, as long as there are coals, this is a quicker process.

There are hot coals of passion but there are also warm flames of entrancing beauty; the fire cannot thrive without both being present.

The television show _How I Met Your Mother_ proposed the idea of "exit ramps" in a relationship at various intervals and many of these stages could reflect the process of building a fire: spark, kindling, tinder, small scraps of wood, increasingly larger logs.

Relationships are also like falcons. You have to let the loved one fly free. On the foot of the hawk or falcon, there is a string that you can hold in your hands so the bird doesn't fly away. No matter how hard it tries, your fingers are stronger than its wings. But it will come to resent you. So you must let it fly free and trust that it will return.

But someone reminded me that you shouldn't think of yourself as the falconer, but as another falcon: "The air is great, come fly."
