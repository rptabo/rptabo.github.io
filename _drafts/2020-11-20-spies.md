After a lot of reading and viewing, I've compiled some basic truths about spies:

- They all speak a dozen languages
- Gadgets and "Op Tech": not only do they exist, but one guy does them all
- Jet lag isn't a thing
- Meetings happen for no reason at locations all over the world
- There's always something with their parents
- Everyone knows how to diffuse any type of bomb
- Every fight comes down to drawn-out hand-to-hand combat
- Female agents are all gorgeous and use their feminine wiles to gain access
- Everyone's a hacker
- You can knock anyone out with a single punch, kick, or blow to the head
- It's easy to fight multiple people at once
