## For Everyone
- It's called the "Entertainment Industry" which means that the content must both make money and be enjoyable to watch
- Given a $20 million budget, most want to spend $19 million on production and whatever's left on P&A. Do the opposite.
- Story is the most important piece.
- You must work harder than all others
  - You have a difficult task ahead, swimming upstream
  - Your mind, soul, and even body will be pushed to the limits
  - For many, the film industry is their religion so you are competing against that
  - Christ gives us an example of redemptive suffering
  - St. Joseph gives us an example of sweat labor
- It is all up to your creativity
  - Find ingenious ways to make a value statement that isn't on the nose and is so perfect it would ruin the story to alter it
- Don't make a "Christian" film
  - Definitely don't make a saint biopic
  - Make an entertaining film that you can stand by with your integrity intact
- If you only work with other Christians, you'll never evangelize but just cannibalize the pond
- Mel Gibson worked in the industry for 23 years before making The Passion of the Christ
- Study what the industry studies
  - Read every book on your topic you can find
  - No matter what role you play, read Robert McKee's STORY
- Expect to start with grunt labor and work your way up
  - Nobody starts at the top and there are a lot of talented people out there
- Live with integrity
  - That is the best way you can evangelize
  - The next time you watch a film, stick around for the credits and see just how many people you have the capacity to witness to
  - Not proselythize, but just show them the Joy of being a Christian
  - It's attractive; people just don't come into contact with many who are living their faith (to paraphrase Gandhi)
- Work as if everything depended on you, pray as though everything depended on God
- Do not be a Catholic writer/producer/director. Be the best writer/producer/director there ever was, _because_ you are Catholic
- Honorariums/leisure connection

## For Writers
- Unless your drafts are in at least the double digits, your screenplay isn't good enough

## For Producers

## For Directors
- Shoot on film
