### For Men
- Have the humility to recognize you don't deserve her and the confidence to believe you are the best for her
- Rejection is always unpleasant to say the least. But in my personal experience, I've found that the women I ask out---even if initially rejecting me---often come around. But ironically, when they are intersted in me, I no longer want to pursue them. I think when I finally get married, it will be either with a woman who says yes the first time or is someone I still like when they are a "convert" and come around after they reject me.

### For Women
- If you think a guy wants to ask you out---especially if you are not interested---give him ample opportunity to do so. There is a saying in Hollywood that also applies here: "The only thing better than a 'yes' is a quick 'no'." You can both move on after the rejection rather than wallowing for an extended period in awkwardness.
