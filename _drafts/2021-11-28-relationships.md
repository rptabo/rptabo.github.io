It is no coincidence that elements of relationships reference fire, for that is truly one of the most analogous guides.

In the early stages, many people ask if there is a "spark" and that is really what is required to start. Many relationships never go past the first date because this is lacking on one or both parties' parts.

But if there is a spark, the next stages are absolutely critical. There must be fuel to continue, however big logs are of no avail; rather, little kindling will allow the nascent fire to grow without being smothered. The spark needs oxygen to develop into a small flame, but also must be protected from the elements so as to avoid being extinguished entirely.

As the flame grows, it requires larger and larger fuel. But the fire must always be fed and as time progresses, this requires logs that must constantly be tended to and added. If the fire is ever neglected for too long, it will ultimately extinguish; the longer it is neglected, the more effort it will take to build it back up and the couple must revisit the early stages again before they can progress back to logs. But luckily, as long as there are coals, this is a quicker process.

There are hot coals of passion but there are also warm flames of entrancing beauty.

The television show _How I Met Your Mother_ proposed the idea of "exit ramps" in a relationship at various intervals and many of these stages could reflect the process of building a fire: spark, kindling, tinder, small scraps of wood, increasingly larger logs.
