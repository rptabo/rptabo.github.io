I would like to see a movement where---rather than always focusing on "Breaking News"---we instead direct our attention towards "Repairing Olds", by which I mean resurfacing the wisdom of those many brilliant men and women who have gone before us.

Very rarely will you find much worthwhile in something new. Ancient wisdom is such because it still applies today. There are so many hidden and relevant gems from the past and nothing new under the sun. Besides, very rarely will the headlines of today even be remembered a week, a year, a decade from now (obviously events like 9/11 are a rare exception but it just points to how few and far between those days are).

I live a very peaceful life because I don't pay attention to the news or social media. And yet, I feel like I stay fairly well-informed on the most important topics because the things that really matter filter up and are what others talk about. So I don't need to actively monitor headlines because I can passively hear about current events. Frankly, even that is a bit too much for my taste.

And yet, reading selections from the Harvard Classics brings me more personal enrichment than the latest story. I am seeped in the best of history's wisdom. Even work-focused, classic Harvard Business Review articles from the 1970s are fairly applicable to today's challenges (for example, the monkey article).

The Cult of the New is stress-inducing. FOMO is a curable disease.

But we need to cultivate this ancient wisdom; make it digestable and easily available, much like James Clear does with his 3-2-1 newsletter.
