I challenged myself to a mental exercise: "What is the root problem, the one thing that makes modern culture bad; the one thing which---if addressed---would put society on a better path?"

Of course there are the Seven Deadly Sins and much of our current predicament is the result of a combination of factors so it is difficult to narrow it down to _one_ overriding vice. But I had this feeling that if I kept peeling away the layers, I could describe in a single word what was "wrong with the world."

I began brainstorming and initially wrote down 33 items fairly quickly. I continued asking myself "but why?" for each subsequent idea, digging deeper until I finally came to my underlying answer: Control. More specifically, the constant desire to control everything, to "be like God".

Seeking control goes all the way back to Adam & Eve in the garden. The serpent eventually persuaded them to eat of the fruit of the tree of Good and Evil because they would "be like God".

Really, control is the

Sin in general. Power, tyranny, corruption, greed.

Want to have sex 24/7 without children? There's contraception for that. It is literally known as "birth control". Still got pregnant? You can get an abortion because it's more important to have control over your future. "Same-sex marriage" (an oxymoron as much as a "four-sided triangle") is exerting control over definitions. Don't like the parts you were born with? You can get new ones or at least "decide" which gender you are. Whatever the next hot-topic social issue becomes, I can just about guarantee it will touch on some form of control.

When Trump was elected, people shut down and then spent the next four years focused on trying to say he didn't win fairly. They probably could have impeached him for any number of things, but they constantly went back to 2016. Their control-centric minds could not reconcile the fact that something happened that they didn't want. It drove them mad, into a frenzy really, so that they were hyped up as if on drugs. They refused to reconcile with reality.

Much of the despair coming from COVID-19 was a result of losing control: being locked in, not able to just "fix" this, a giant push for the vaccine to "solve" it.

To be fair, this is also---albeit to a much lesser extent---one of the reasons for the "birther" movement with Obama and to a more equivalent extent, the "election fraud" movement with Biden. But I think this just proves the point that control is a malady that affects both sides of the aisle: it is the true pandemic of our times. (I'd argue liberals, which tend to be less religious and also arguably suffer from more vices, manifest the ailment more however.)

I believe one reason Silicon Valley tends to be made up of so many liberals---and particularly atheists---is because they are constantly used to playing God and having total control over everything so they have no need of God. They are creating and maintaining worlds and within the universe of zeroes and ones, they are omnipotent. (But they forget that the true God is also omniscient, which they strive for but can never achieve.)

To a lesser extent, with the proliferation of technology and more and more of us living in worlds dominated by smart phones, streaming, and other purely technological work and entertainment, we also feel in control.

Comfort. The fable of the Princess and the Pea is not inaccurate: the more we are accustomed to comfort, the more the smallest discomfort makes an impact.

Control and comfort both infinitely approach the limit (an "asymptote" in mathematics).

Some people tend more towards comfort than control, but this just lifts the people in power. Socialism is giving up individual control from the proletariat level in order to have more comfort (it never works out that way, but this is what people are doing; in effect, they are just giving even more control to those at the top).

I've always found it annoying when someone points out a societal ill but fails to provide any sort of remedy. I would like to provide a few possible solutions:

1. Read books on abandonment. I highly recommend Uniformity with God's Will, Abandonment to Divine Providence, and Trustful Surrender to Divine Providence: The Secret of Peace and Happiness. Tangentially, consecrations such as True Devotion to Mary and Consecration to St. Joseph.
2. Evangelize
3. Emphasize this through story

I asked my mom the same question and see said "lack of respect for life".

I had ended my "brainstorming" list by asking the question "What is the root cause of mass shootings?" and then turned to this blog to look at the topics I've covered in the past (because obviously those are the societal ills I felt strongly needed to be addressed). The first post that jumped out was "Letter to Planned Parenthood" so I wrote down on my list "Disrespect for life/the culture of death." Only later, after discussion with my mom, did I see that I had answered my own question about mass shootings on the line above with the same answer given by her!

Not "Ctrl-Alt-Del", but rather "Ctrl. Alt: Del!" (Control. Alternative: Deliverance)
