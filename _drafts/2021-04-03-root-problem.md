I challenged myself to a mental exercise: "What is the root problem, the one thing that makes modern culture bad; the one thing which---if addressed---would put society on a better path?"

Of course there are the Seven Deadly Sins and much of our current predicament is the result of a combination of factors. But I had this feeling that if I kept peeling away the layers, I could describe in a single word what was "wrong with the world."

I started brainstorming and wrote down 33 items to start. But as I kept asking "but why?" for each of those, digging deeper, I finally came to my answer: Control.

Adam & Eve in the garden. Sin in general. Power, tyranny, corruption, greed.

Technology
- Atheism

Comfort

Control and comfort both infinitely approach the limit.

I asked my mom the same question and see said "lack of respect for life".

I had ended my "brainstorming" list by asking the question "What is the root cause of mass shootings?" and then turned to this blog to look at the topics I've covered in the past (because obviously those are the societal ills I felt strongly needed to be addressed). The first post that jumped out was "Letter to Planned Parenthood" so I wrote down on my list "Disrespect for life/the culture of death." Only later, after discussion with my mom, did I see that I had answered my own question about mass shootings on the line above with the same answer given by her!
