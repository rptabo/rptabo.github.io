Happiness can only be found in the present moment. Looking for it elsewhere---or rather, elsewhen---is futile. No matter how near or distant your mind travels to the past or the future, it leaves happiness behind. The irony is that happiness cannot traverse time, but it can be transported across space.

A 10 | It is only in the present moment<br>
B  8 | That happiness is to be found<br>
A  3 | ...we know meant<br>
B  7 | Yet to space it is not bound<br>
