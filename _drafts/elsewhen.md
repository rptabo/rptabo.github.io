Happiness can only be found in the present moment. Looking for it elsewhere---or rather, _elsewhen_---is futile. No matter how near or distant your mind travels to the past or the future, it leaves happiness behind. It's well known that people look for love in all the wrong places, but they also tend to seek happiness in all the wrong times.

The irony is that happiness cannot traverse time, but it can be transported across space.

| A | 10 | It is only in the present moment,
| B | 10 | The Now, that happiness is to be found.
| A | 10 | To go look for it elsewhen we know meant
| B | 10 | Naught; and yet within space it is not bound.
|   |    |
| C | 10 | Happiness is unable to traverse
| D | 10 | Neither near nor far in future or past.
| C | 10 | Rooted forever right now is precurse
| D | 10 | Since the deepest sorrow it will outlast.
|   |    |
| E | 10 | Go searching not in places wrong for love,
| F | 10 | Nor in times other seek ye happiness;
| E | 10 | For much like of olden days from a dove
| F | 10 | Total bliss unto you may Pappy bless.
|   |    |
| G | 10 | So heed these words that have been etched in pen:
| G | 10 | Do not go scour for happiness...Elsewhen.

Rooted

Contained within a pen
