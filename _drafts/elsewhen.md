Happiness can only be found in the present moment. Looking for it elsewhere---or rather, _elsewhen_---is futile. No matter how near or distant your mind travels to the past or the future, it leaves happiness behind. It's well known that people look for love in all the wrong places, but they also tend to seek happiness in all the wrong times.

The irony is that happiness cannot traverse time, but it can be transported across space.
