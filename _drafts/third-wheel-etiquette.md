## Definitions
Before we break into the intricacies of third wheel etiquette, it's important to define what it actually is. Since it's widely recognized that the best three opening words of any speech are "Webster's dictionary defines..." then I'd like to begin with some definitions.

"Third" is the spelled-out ordinal form of the cardinal number 3 (three). Keep this number in mind because it's going to come up quite a bit in the following discussion.

A "wheel", according to Wikipedia, is "a circular block of a hard and durable material at whose center has been bored a hole through which is placed an axle bearing about which the wheel rotates when torque is applied to the wheel about its axis."

Finally, "etiquette" requires a bit more etymology and like our subject itself, the word is made up of _three_ [see, there it is again] parts:
  - "et" is the Latin word for "and"
  - "iqu" is the Old German spelling of "ich" meaning "I"
  - "ette" is a French suffix meaning "little"

So as you can see, "etiquette" is a truly universal word as hopefully third wheel etiquette becomes universally practiced. Putting these three parts together, we see that "etiquette" literally means "and I a little."

So summing it up, third wheel etiquette is not two, not four, but three circular bored blocks rotating a round an axle...including a little bit of you.

## Introduction
Nobody _wants_ to be a third wheel, but sometimes it simply can't be avoided. For example, you might be bored and they're doing something fun.

## The Rules

- Ask lots of questions. Dig deep. Make it personal.
- Ask lots of questions (the deeper & more personal, the better).
- Try to sit between them so there's less awkwardness
- Listen, they _want_ to buy you a third ticket, it is just your responsibility to relieve them of the burden of being too forward
