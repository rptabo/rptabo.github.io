# Third Wheel Etiquette
Break down of each word: third, wheel, etiquette
  - Third: ordinal number between second and fourth
  - "A wheel, according to Wikipedia, is..."
  - Etiquette: Et: from the Latin "and"; iqu from the Old German spelling of "ich" or "I"; ette: suffix meaning "little": "And I a little" - the inference is that you are a lot.

Sometimes you can't avoid it: you're bored & they're doing something fun

Ask lots of questions. Dig deep. Make it personal. | Ask lots of questions (the deeper & more personal, the better).

Try to sit between them so there's less awkwardness

They _want_ to buy you a third ticket, you just have to relieve them of the burden of being too forward

Definitely needs to be a pseudonym, but not super on-the-nose

Author profile: lifetime third-wheeler, has lately been trying to break into the fifth wheel game by joining double dates

Who this book is for: "pregnant or may be come pregnant" - but for single people. Single people that happen to know someone in a relationship. Remember, loved ones die.
