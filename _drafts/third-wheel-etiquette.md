# By Donald O'Treply

## Definitions
Before we break into the intricacies of third wheel etiquette, it's important to define what it actually is. Since it's widely recognized that the best three opening words of any speech are "Webster's dictionary defines"

Break down of each word: third, wheel, etiquette
  - Third: ordinal number between second and fourth
  - "A wheel, according to Wikipedia, is..."

"Etiquette" requires a bit more etymology and like our subject itself, the word is made up of three parts:
  - "et" is the Latin word for "and"
  - "iqu" is the Old German spelling of "ich" meaning "I"
  - "ette" is a French suffix meaning "little"

So as you can see, it is a truly universal word, and hopefully third wheel etiquette becomes universally practiced. Putting these three parts together, we see that "etiquette" literally means "and I a little."

## Introduction
Sometimes you can't avoid it: you're bored & they're doing something fun

Ask lots of questions. Dig deep. Make it personal. | Ask lots of questions (the deeper & more personal, the better).

Try to sit between them so there's less awkwardness

They _want_ to buy you a third ticket, you just have to relieve them of the burden of being too forward

Definitely needs to be a pseudonym, but not super on-the-nose
