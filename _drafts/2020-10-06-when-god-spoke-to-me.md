List the first five letters of the alphabet:

A<br>
B<br>
C<br>
D<br>
E<br>

Next to that, in a separate column, list the five vowels:

A  A<br>
B  E<br>
C  I<br>
D  O<br>
E  U<br>

Right now you are at level four, "do":

A  A<br>
B  E<br>
C  I<br>
**D  O**<br>
E  U<br>

I need you to take two steps back:

```
   A  A
-> B  E
|  C  I
\- D  O
   E  U
```

and just "be":

A  A<br>
**B  E**<br>
C  I<br>
D  O<br>
E  U<br>

We are human beings, not human doings.
