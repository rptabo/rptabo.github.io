I have noticed a strong correlation between the general attitude of a populace and geography within America. The more chill to more high-strung goes from the southwest to the northeast. Southern California is pretty chill but also productive. New York is very uptight. San Francisco is a little north of SoCal and they are also a little more uptight. DC is south of New York so it's slightly (better but I've also never seen so many people work harder to accomplish less). The Midwest is very hardworking so somewhat in-between. Hawaii is almost too chill that they don't really accomplish anything.

I discussed this theory with someone recently and they pointed out people sometimes talk according to the weather. When you're cold you want to rush to get to the next place, not spending a lot of time outside and you also talk more quickly, forcing the words out. But when the weather is nice, you have time to enjoy yourself.
