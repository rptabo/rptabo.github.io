(Devout) Catholics have the best [...] for at least the following reasons:

- Commitment is key
- Contraception makes things worse
- Being open to life makes it better
- No pornography, past sexual experiences
- Discipline, communication
- Really let loose once the NFP nights are over
- Don't have to worry about which date is appropriate to sleep together
- Less emphasis on size, other uncontrollable attributes
- No STD or pregnancy scares
- Lasts a lifetime and only gets stronger
- JPII: ladies first
- By not putting all of the focus on sex, it actually leads to better times in the bedroom
- Less emphasis on sex creates more opportunities for romance
- People think they want pleasure, but that's momentary: they really want happiness and fornication and contraception does not lead to that
